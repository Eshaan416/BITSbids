# BITSbids

The problem statement is as follows:

<blockquote>
A webapp that can run on desktop and mobiles, to make a bidding platform for selling used products (electronic gadgets, books, sports item etc.) from students to students. The salient features includes: 

- Product search (better if contextual)
- Bidding on a product till a deadline 
- Private messaging with seller. 

Every account is through BITS email SSO and outsiders are not allowed. 
For bidding use a virtual currency. (BITScoin maybe!) 

Product listing should contain pictures (if possible short video clips also), description, and asking price. 
The seller and buyer should be in double blind (no one  should see the personal details or even name of the other one) till the bid is frozen.

And yes, everyone is both a buyer and a seller.
